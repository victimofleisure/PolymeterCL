# PolymeterCL

This a command line fork of the Polymeter MIDI Sequencer, with all user interface code removed. This project builds a Windows command line application which will open and play a Polymeter (.plm) document. This greatly reduces the number of lines of code, which could facilitate porting the Polymeter MIDI Sequencer to other platforms. Be advised that this project still depends on MFC, and on the Windows API, and in particular on the MIDI streams API.
