# PolymeterCL

This is a command line fork of the Polymeter MIDI Sequencer, with all user interface code removed. This project builds a Windows command line application which opens and plays a Polymeter (.plm) document. This greatly reduces the number of lines of code, which could facilitate porting the sequencer to other platforms. Be advised that this project still depends on MFC, and on the Windows API, and particularly on the MIDI streams API.
